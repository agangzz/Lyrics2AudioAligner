Class Design: 

RecordingSegmenter
 is just a holder of two methods: 
 No class fields. 
 
 RecordingSegmenter.alignOneRecording- 
 	for each section from MakamRecording, gets lyrics from makamRecording and  calls 
 
 RecordingSegmenter.RecordingSegmenter.alignOneChunk  - to align a single chunk. 
	these methods of segmenting maybe better to put in MakamRecording?  


MakamRecording - all recording-specific info, sections. Handles the mapping between score and recording sections. 
Note that There might be omissions and change of order in a recording of a given composition.  
self.sections - recording-specific sections 
self.makamScore
self.audioFile


MakamScore 
field sectionLyrics is a map: 
e.g.
"nakarat" -> "word1 word2 word3"

each word is of object type Word, each Word in its turn contains a list of object type Syllable


Phonetizer
grapheme2phoneme(word) 
turkishlyrics2PhoneticDict parses all words and turns them into a HTK-format dictionary. 
HTK takes the sequence of words (mlf file) and the dict and  expands them internally  


Aligner - most important class

self.lyrics - stores lyrics for given audio

Aligner.Aligner.alignAudio - creates word-level grammar file and dict file; runs alignment with HTK

incl. feature extraction



MakamScore.createTranscriptForSection - just array of all phonems, used in matlab dtw
