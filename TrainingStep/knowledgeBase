The proto file defines the topology of a model. 
It is just multiplicated in the flat-start hmmdefs file for each monophone from the monophones. 

the macros file - 

HCompV - initialize the parameters of the models


HERest does only one iteration. But have in mind each given file for retraining is used. which means it is run incrementally on the features of each file.
