II. ADAPTATION: 

MAIN_TRAIN_DIR=/Users/joro/Documents/Phd/UPF/METUdata/
TRAIN_OUTPUT=$MAIN_TRAIN_DIR/model_output

### (input and output are in folder /Users/joro/Documents/Phd/UPF/voxforge/auto
/adaptation)

-1) 
# dir should have .wav .txt and files with for each file to be adapted 
# prepare .txt just all words in METUbet script,
ADAPTATION_DIR_WITH_PHN_AND_WRD_FILES=/Users/joro/Documents/Phd/UPF/Turkey-makam/




1) create dict file. mix speech dict and adaptation dict: 



/Users/joro/Documents/Phd/UPF/voxforge/myScripts/turkishLyrics2phoneDict.sh  $ADAPTATION_DIR_WITH_PHN_AND_WRD_FILES 1  ${TRAIN_OUTPUT}/pronunciation_dict ${ADAPTATION_DIR_WITH_PHN_AND_WRD_FILES}/pronunciation_dict.adapted

# do manually: delete SIL (with capital letters) and SILSIL from /Users/joro/Documents/Phd/UPF/voxforge/auto/scripts/interim_files/monophones1

2) prepare phoneme-level mlf
python /Users/joro/Documents/Phd/UPF/voxforge/myScripts/utils/sonicVisTextPhnDir2mlf.py $ADAPTATION_DIR_WITH_PHN_AND_WRD_FILES ${ADAPTATION_DIR_WITH_PHN_AND_WRD_FILES}/all.phn.mlf


3) adapt
$UPF/voxforge/myScripts/buildAdaptedModel.sh  ${ADAPTATION_DIR_WITH_PHN_AND_WRD_FILES}  ${ADAPTATION_DIR_WITH_PHN_AND_WRD_FILES}/pronunciation_dict.adapted ${ADAPTATION_DIR_WITH_PHN_AND_WRD_FILES}/all.phn.mlf  ${ADAPTATION_DIR_WITH_PHN_AND_WRD_FILES}/adaptedModel 


resulting new model: 
${ADAPTATION_DIR_WITH_PHN_AND_WRD_FILES}/adaptedModel/hmmdefs.gmllrmean
